# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background

The purpose of this analysis is to show comparisons between different play kickstarter campaigns based on launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Compared the amount of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns to the time of year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Compared the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled campaigns to their goal amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Some potential difficulties that could be encountered could be the lack of specific data that could have had a large impact on success/failure outcomes for play Kickstarter campaigns. For example, the country that a campaign started in could factor into whether a campaign achieves its goals or not. Another factor could be what marketing strategy was used for each campaign. Without this essential data, it could be difficult to tell the true reasons behind a campaign’s success or failure. 

## Results


Play Kickstarter campaigns found the most success between the months of April/May through July.  More play Kickstarter campaigns failed when they were launched between October and January.


By comparing the number of successful, failed, and canceled play campaigns and separating by goal amount, the data shows that campaigns under $1000 to $5000 found a 70% success rate.  It was also notable that campaigns between $25,000 to under $35,000 saw a 70% failure rate, and campaigns $45,000 and higher saw a failure rate of 88% and above.


Some limitations of this data set are that there is not enough insight into the individual contributors to these campaigns.   We don’t know why certain campaigns with high goals were very successful, sometimes fundraising over 2000% of their goal, while other campaigns with lower goals failed, going against the trends.  Again, I wonder how these campaigns were marketed. 


Using this data, I believe creating graphs comparing location to outcomes and goals, could further help with deciding where to promote your play Kickstarter campaign in the future. This could give more specific insight into the best places to launch new campaigns.
