# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns to assess trends

After looking at the data, it is my recommendation  that theatre kickstarter campaigns are successful. However, with the average donation being only around $80, theatre kickstarter campaigns are more successful with a smaller goal, around $5,000. Since the data shows that the highest amount of cmapaign contributions came between the months of March and June, March would be the ideal time period in which to start the campaign.
