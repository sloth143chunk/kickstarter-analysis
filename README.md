# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns to assess trends

It is my reccomendation after looking at the data, theatre kickstarter campaigns are successful however, they are more successful with a smaller goal, around $5,000.  This is because the average donation was around $80. You should try and start your campaign between March and June since the data showed those months had the highest amount of contributions.
